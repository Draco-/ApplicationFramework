1.    Introduction
1.1. What is the application framework meant for
       The application framework is meant as a programming framework and a collection of classes to make it easier to develop a PyQt application using version 4
       of the PyQt library (PyQt4).
       It provides a collection of classes, that build a standalone application (without any specific functionality) which is able to run and show the basic behaviour of
       an application.
       
       This basic behaviour includes:
       - Start the application
       - Show a main window for the application, including the functionality, that is basic for the operation system (resize window, move window, close the application)
         This functionality is provided by the PyQt4 library
       - Enable a closedown of the main window.
       
       Additional functionality is provided by separate modules of the application framework.
       
1.2. Overview over the philosophy of the application framework
       The application framework follows a classic model - controller - view paradigm, as described in standard programming literature.
       In order to clarify my nomenclature and to make it easier to follow this description, I use the following structure.
       
       
       user --- gui --- view --- model --- backframe --- reality
                      |          |             |
                      |          ---contr ---
                      |           
                    application controll
                    application services
